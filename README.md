# Acral_Melanoma_PDX_mixed_analyses
A collection of various analyses for the Acral Melanoma PDX paper


To reproducing our R environment we used renv package. The project contains an renv file, which records the dependencies used.
If you're interested in reproducing our R environment:

```R
renv::restore() # To rebuild an environment from the renv.lockfile
```




The `here` package was used to manage our file paths. 

All R scripts were run using `R v4.4.1` and the packaged dependencies for each analysis are detailed within the `renv.lock` file of each analysis folder in the `scripts` directory.
